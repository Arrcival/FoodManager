# FoodManager

A personal project in WPF aiming to manage food, recipes and such for a personal usage.

Is linked to a mongo database.


I had in mind :
- Listing every ingredients
- Listing every recipes, linking to ingredients
- Being able to save what ingredients I have (with peremption date)
- Being able to display what recipes I can actually do
- Being able to display recipes that would use oldest ingredients
